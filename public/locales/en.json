By giving everyone the option to choose between DDR3 or DDR4 ram, budget users can choose our DDR3 ram option. In most cases DDR3 ram is fast enough to start with and is a bit cheaper than DDR4 ram. Check what the best option is in your case or contact our support. They are happy to help you to choose the best option for you!"

Because of that we prefer Palican above Pterodactyl. In case you want back to the OG pterodactyl you could get a VPS or Dedicated server and install it yourself. Our support team would be happy to help you through the installation!"
